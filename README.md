# Nucleosynthesis data set
## Data set that contains the non-repited cases of nucleosynthesis based on branches of the CNO and HCNO cycles

The data set has 23 instances corresponding to the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycles (I, II, III and IV) and Hot CNO (I, II and III). These are described at [Wikipedia CNO cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle)

The 17 classes are the different isotopes found in the presented cycles, these are: <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>4</sup>He, <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>14</sup>N,<sup>15</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>16</sup>O,<sup>17</sup>O,<sup>18</sup>O,<sup>17</sup>F,<sup>18</sup>F,<sup>19</sup>F,<sup>18</sup>Ne, <sup>19</sup>Ne.
